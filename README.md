CA682 Data Visualisation Assignment


This is a final project of Data Visualization and Management course. The analysis was developed with Python and is about discovering and visualizing the relationship between suicides and unemployment.

Two datasets were obtained from Kaggle.com :
        1. Suicide Rates:
                https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016
        .
        2. Unemployment Rates:
                https://www.kaggle.com/sovannt/world-bank-youth-unemployment
           
The suicide and unemployment datasets were cleaned and transformed to be merged on countries for the visualization.
